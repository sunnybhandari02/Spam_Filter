# SPAM FILTERING SYSTEM

In this project I build a model for classifying the SMS/Email into spam or ham through the text of the SMS/Email using standard classifiers.

Dataset :-
The SMS/Email Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS/Email Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,567
messages, tagged according being ham (legitimate) or spam.
